# Overview

This project connects to a Google Firebase cloud server that functions as a library. To use it, simply run it and type Help to see all of the functions. You will also need to have a file that contains your key to get into the server.

I wrote this software to more fully understand how cloud databases work and how to interface with them. 

I got my data set from [here](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/01/top-100-books-of-all-time)

# Cloud Database

I chose to go with Google Firebase, as it was free and an easy way to start.

The database is structured like a large list, each with dictionaries inside of them. The key values for each book are randomly generated by the server itself as to ensure no duplicates when multiple people are pushing changes.

# Development Environment

This was developed using Visual studio code and python. I used pandas for some initial data cleaning before uploading it into the server. To connect, I used the firebase_admin package.

# Future Work

* Add error checking to everything, specifically to command entering as well as querying
* When adding books, ensure they have all fields when uploading, even if unused ones are left blank
* Add better user authentication
